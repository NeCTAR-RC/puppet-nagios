# == Define: nagios::service
#
#  The Nagios type service. This resource type is autogenerated using the
#  model developed in Naginator, and all of the Nagios types are generated
#  using the same code and the same library.
#
#  This type generates Nagios configuration statements in Nagios-parseable
#  configuration files. By default, the statements will be added to
#  /etc/nagios/nagios_service.cfg, but you can send them to a different file
#  by setting their target attribute.
#
#  You can purge Nagios resources using the resources type, but only in the
#  default file locations. This is an architectural limitation.
